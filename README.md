# MinecraftManhunt
An open source, fully featured Minecraft manhunt plugin.

This plugin is modeled after Dream's Manhunt Plugin and includes:
- Tracking the "hunted" player (the runner)
- Tracking the most recent portal in the overworld the runner made
- Tracking the runner in the nether
- Disabling tracking in the end
- Giving players a compass on server join or respawn

# How To Use
Download the Manhunt.jar from (here)[https://github.com/wawesomeNOGUI/MinecraftManhunt/releases/download/1.0/Manhunt.jar]. 

(Or look in the github release to the right)
Next place the Manhunt.jar in the plugins folder of a Spigot-like server (Spigot, Paper, etc).
Finally run the server and have all players join, then type in: 
- **/hunt playerName**

Replace "playerName" with the name of one of the online players like this: **/hunt wawesome**

Have Fun!
