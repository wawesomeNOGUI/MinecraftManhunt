# MinecraftManhunt
An open source, fully featured Minecraft manhunt plugin.

This plugin is modeled after Dream's Manhunt Plugin and includes:
- Tracking the "hunted" player (the runner)
- Tracking the most recent portal in the overworld/ nether the runner made (If the runner isn't in that dimension)
- Tracking the runner in the nether
- Disabling tracking in the end
- Giving players a compass on server join or respawn

# How To Use
Download the Manhunt.jar from [here](https://github.com/wawesomeNOGUI/MinecraftManhunt/releases/download/1.1/Manhunt.jar). 

(Or look in the github release to the right)

Next place the Manhunt.jar in the plugins folder of a Spigot-like server (Spigot, Paper, etc).
Finally run the server and have all players join, then type in: 
- **/hunt playerName**

Replace "playerName" with the name of one of the online players like this: **/hunt wawesome**

The hunter's just have to right click their compass to track the runner's most recent location, or if the runner is not in the same dimension, the compass will track the runner's most recent portal they made.

Have Fun!
